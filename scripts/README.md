# Steps to run

### Installation (OSX directions)

1. Clone this repo. You can fork it to keep track of your own changes on github if you want, and submit PRs to this repo.

2. Install pyenv (https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv)

3. Install python 2.7.x using pyenv, e.g. pyenv install 2.7.11

4. Install virtualenv: `[sudo] pip install virtualenv`

5. Create virtualenv in scripts dir & install requirements

	  virtualenv -p ~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.11/bin/python2.7 venv
	  source venv/bin/activate
	  pip install -r requirements.txt
	  
6. Install ffmpeg (note: this is not isolated along with python dependencies, this will be systemwide):
brew options ffmpeg, then install w/ as many options as possible (except chromaprint). with-freetype is definitely required; not sure of all others.

7. (OPTIONAL) IF using matplotlib for anything (you don't need to except if you're making plots of looking time data in python!), make a separate virtualenv to do that because you'll need a framework version of python:

```
	brew install python --framework
	virtualenv -p /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.12_1/bin/python2.7 fwenv
```

from http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html:

> The best known workaround, borrowed from the WX wiki, is to use the non virtualenv python along with the PYTHONHOME environment variable. This can be implemented in a script as below. To use this modify PYVER and PATHTOPYTHON and put the script in the virtualenv bin directory i.e. `PATHTOVENV/bin/frameworkpython`
	
```
		#!/bin/bash

		# what real Python executable to use
		PYVER=2.7
		PATHTOPYTHON=/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.12_1/bin/
		PYTHON=${PATHTOPYTHON}python${PYVER}

		# find the root of the virtualenv, it should be the parent of the dir this script is in
		ENV=`$PYTHON -c "import os; print(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(\"$0\"), '..')))"`

		# now run Python with the virtualenv set as Python's HOME
		export PYTHONHOME=$ENV
		exec $PYTHON "$@"
```

With this in place you can run frameworkpython to get an interactive framework build within the virtualenv. To run a script you can do frameworkpython test.py where test.py is a script that requires a framework build. To run an interactive IPython session with the framework build within the virtual environment you can do `frameworkpython -m IPython`

```
source fwenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
```

Now to run anything that requires matplotlib, you just use frameworkpython in place of python.

8. Install AWS command-line tools: see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
    
    `sudo pip install awscli`

    `aws configure`

        enter keys (saved; can make new keys from AWS console)
        region: us-east-1

## Configuration

### Generate OSF token
You will need to generate a personal access token on the OSF to run this script. Visit:

- [https://staging.osf.io/settings/tokens/](https://staging.osf.io/settings/tokens/)  _or_
- [https://osf.io/settings/tokens/](https://osf.io/settings/tokens/)

to do this.

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CenterForOpenScience/lookit/develop/scripts/pat-example.png)

**Make sure to save this token's value! You will not be able to retrieve it again.**

### Obtain Lookit token
You will also need a Lookit token, generated via the Lookit admin interface by an admin. Ask Kim.

### Obtain SendGrid key
To send email, you'll need a SendGrid key, generated by an admin. Ask Kim.

### Create a .env

Create a new file name .env in the current directory (where this README is). It should look like:

```
OSF_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-osf-token>
LOOKIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-lookit-token>

SENDGRID_KEY=<your-sendgrid-acct-key>

LOOKIT_URL=https://lookit.mit.edu

BASE_DIR='/Users/kms/lookitcodingmultilab/'
VIDEO_DIR='video'
EXPORT_DIR='export'
SESSION_DIR='sessions'
DATA_DIR='data'
CODING_DIR='coding'
FFMPEG_PATH='/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg'
```

You'll need to fill in your keys, the `BASE_DIR` where you want all your data files and coding to live (full path, quoted, with leading and trailing slashes), and the path to ffmpeg (likewise).

Each the scripts accept an argument to point to a specific .env file (e.g. '.env-stage' or '.env-prod'), which you can use if you're working with both staging and production servers. For example:

```bash
python coding.py -config .env-stage
```

### Using the scripts

- To use the coding functions, first navigate to this directory (scripts) by opening the
Terminal program and typing cd [path to scripts], e.g.
cd /Volumes/NovelToy2/CurrentProjects/Lookit/scripts/

- `source venv/bin/activate` in order to get into the virtual environment; then can call python scripts.

- For instructions on how to use coding.py, type
	python coding.py --help
from this directory.

### Setting up automation, on OSX:

- Edit the .plist file to use the correct path to updateLookit.sh (in this directory), to set the working directory to this directory, and to use .err/.out files in this directory. (Replace /Users/kms/lookitkim/scripts/ with this directory wherever you see it.)
- Copy the .plist file into $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents
- Make sure updateLookit.sh is executable: chmod +x updateLookit.sh (from this directory)
- Start the process: launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.lookit.update.plist
- You can stop using launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.lookit.update.plist.
- You can see the output and any errors in autoSync.err and autoSync.out.

### Local data storage overview 

Warning: these may not be up-to-date. Would recommend loading the actual pickled files
and exploring a little to update.

.env file defines:
- Video directory (where raw videos live)
- Batch video directory (where batched videos live)
- Coding directory (where human-readable spreadsheets live)
- Coder names
- Data directory (everything below is data)

Coding: dict with sessionKey as keys, values are dicts with structure:
- Consent
- coderComments
    coderName
- videosExpected: list of video filenames expected, based on session data
- videosFound: list of video filenames actually found; list of lists corresponding to videosExpected

Accounts: dict with user uuids as keys. [Add example value here]

Sessions: array of dicts each with the following structure (directly from server):
- Attributes
    - Feedback
    - Sequence
    - expData
        - [frame-name]
            - eventTimings
                - eventType (nextFrame, ...)
                - timestamp
            - ...
    - experimentId
    - profileId (username.child)
    - conditions
    - completed
    - hasReadFeedback
- meta
    - created-on
- id (=sessionKey)

Videos: keys are filenames (.flv/.mp4)
- shortName - subset of video name as used by sessions
- framerate
- duration
- expId
- sessionKey
- inBatches (key=batchId)
    - position
- mp4Path_[suffix] - relative, from SESSION_DIR. '' if not created yet.
- mp4Dur_[suffix] - duration of the mp4 in seconds; -1 if not created yet; 0 if could not be created.

email: keys are profileIds (e.g. kim2.zlkjs OR in new version uuids), values are lists of emails sent regarding that child's participation in this study.

Note: suffix is 'whole' or 'trimmed'; these fields are created when updating video data, although others could also be added.
